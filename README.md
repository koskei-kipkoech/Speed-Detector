# **Speed Detector**
This a simple JavaScript program meant to check a car's speed and determines if the driver should receive demerit points. If the speed exceeds a certain limit, demerit points are calculated, and if the driver accumulates more than 12 points, their license is suspended.

# **How it Works**
- The speed limit is set to 70km/h.
- For every 5 km/h over the limit, the driver is supposed to receive 1 demerit point.
- If the speed is 70 km/h or less, it prints "Ok!".
- If the speed exceeds 70 km/h, the program calculates demerit points.
- If the driver receives more than 12 demerit points, it prints "License suspended".

# **How to use it**
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the index.html file in your browser or run the code in a Javascript environment.
3. Enter the speed of the car when prompted.
